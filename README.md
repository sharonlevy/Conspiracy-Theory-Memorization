## Dataset
This dataset consists of popular conspiracy theory topics from Wikipedia's category list in ```Wikipedia_topics.txt```. Our process in selecting these topics is described in our paper.

The other three files consist of conspiracy theories generated by GPT-2 Large with the text prompt "The conspiracy theory is that". Each file represents the temperature
setting used when generating the text (0.4, 0.7, 1).
